    <h1>Biografy</h1>
    <p>
        Relatively little was known about Vermeer's life until recently. He seems to have been devoted exclusively to
        his art, living out his life in the city of Delft. Until the 19th century, the only sources of information were
        a few registers, official documents, and comments by other artists; for this reason, Thoré-Bürger named him "The
        Sphinx of Delft".

        Vermeer may have first executed his paintings tonally like most painters of his time, using either monochrome
        shades of grey r a limited palette of browns and greys ("dead coloring"), over which he would apply more
        saturated colors (reds, yellows and blues) in the form of transparent glazes. No drawings have been positively
        attributed to Vermeer, and his paintings offer few clues to preparatory methods.
